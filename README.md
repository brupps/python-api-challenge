# python-api-challenge

This challenge consisted of two parts - WeatherPy and VacationPy. In WeatherPy, I looked at weather trends from random cities 
around the world and compared their latitude with other weather factors such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. In addition, I added linear regression and divded the results between northern and southern hemispheres.
